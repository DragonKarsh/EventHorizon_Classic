# EventHorizon_Classic
EventHorizon rewrite for World of Warcraft Classic


I only play Shadow Priest, and have only implemented what I needed/wanted to play. You are more than welcome to fork and extend this implementation to include whatever you desire. I will not be providing any support for this though.

Conceptually, everything is the same as the original TBC/Wotlk version of this addon. There may be some changes required when hasted dots become a thing in Wotlk. However, there is very little code that I have reused. Part of this reason was because I wanted to learn more Lua, and so I attempted to challenge myself with some different concepts (which may or may not be completely bad). I also needed to make sure I understood the original code completely, which meant being able to reinterpret the code in my own way mattered a lot. I hope that what I have provided is an easier to maintain and follow codebase than the original, which also allowing for extensions to occur quicker and seamlessly.
