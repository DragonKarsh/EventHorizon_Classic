Conceptually, everything is the same as the original TBC/Wotlk version of this addon. As I only play Shadow Priest, I do not intend to add any features to this which do not affect my class. While you should be able to make this work for other classes, any class specific change such as shaman totems or various class personal buffs are not implemented, and there is no desire to do so.
